## Research Interests

My current research interests primarily focus on **FinLLM**, particularly the development of predictive models for various commodities using **Large Language Models (LLMs)** combined with **multimodal data**. I welcome researchers interested in this field to reach out to me for collaboration.

Additionally, another area of my research involves **financial time series forecasting** using statistical methods. This includes:

- Construction of **factor models** for alternative data (such as derivatives markets),
- Improvements to various **predictive models**,
- Emphasis on **model stability** and **generalization capabilities**.
